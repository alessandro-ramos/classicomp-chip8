# The Classicomp Chip8 Emulator
A minimalist multiplatform Chip-8 virtual machine written in Java.

This project is the result of my curiosity about emulation on the early 2000s.

At that time I have translated an article from a web site called goldroad to brazilian portuguese language.

Some years after that, I published the text with an alpha version of this emulator in the GUJ (Java Users Group) forum.

# Project status
It can emulate many classic Chip-8 roms.
It doesn't support SuperChip programs.

# Future work
Implement sound emulation
Improve I/O performance
